# Tests / Sandbox

This folder is for experiments, prototypes, and throwaway tests.

Suggestions:
- Create small TS/JS files to try out utilities or Supabase calls.
- Keep app-facing tests under a framework (Vitest/Jest) if you decide to add one.
- Use `.gitignore` here if you generate local artifacts.

Examples you could add:
- `supabase-connection.ts` to verify envs and a simple query.
- `ui-sandbox.md` to note UI tweaks to try.

No test runner is configured yet. If you want, I can wire up Vitest or Cypress next.
